A port of the nRF UART android App into Android Studio 1.0.1. The orignal nRF UART source code was obtained from https://developer.mbed.org/forum/wiki-16691-forum/topic/5134/

This App implements a simple text based send and receive service.

To test this code with the nRF51822 mbed KIT you need to run BLE_LoopackUART which is available
